        <br>
        <p> Hello! My name is Azima Tarannum and I am a Dhaka-born and Toronto-based artist! The 'Tara' from my name means stars in Bangla so I decided to brand myself as 'nokshatara' which loosely translates to a constellation - so here I am, bringing in the creativity from the stars.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I've always used traditional media to draw, but during the pandemic I decided to invest in an iPad to take on digital illustrations. My experience has been a huge learning curve and I am still improving while developing my art style.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My illustrations are inspired by my moods and thoughts. I gear towards cute things which make me and everyone around me happy. My experience revolves around kids illustration, animal illustration and I am interested in anything that will help me grow! If you ever want to collaborate, feel free to contact me! </p>
